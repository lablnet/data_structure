# Data Structures and Algorithms  
Several data structures and Algorithms implementations in C++  
  
### Installations
Clone this repo recursively because it have two *git submodules* 
```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/lablnet/Data_Structure.git
```
Build it
```sh
cmake .
```
```sh
make
```

Run tests
```sh
./bin./unit_tests
```
